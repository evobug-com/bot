# Development
- use `bunx tsgo --noEmit` to check typescript errors. If there is no output, it means everything is ok.
- use `bunx oxlint --type-aware --type-check` to check lint errors.

# Typescript
- Never use 'any' type, it is disabling typescript. Instead figure out what is wrong and plan to fix it.

# Tests
- All code must have tests.

# Other
- Do not commit any md file unless you are explicitly told to do it.
